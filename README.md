# DevProject

This projects implements a combinatorial logic application which allows the user to create sheet based components.

## Sheet 📄 :

The strenght of this application is that you can easily create **sheets**. From this sheet you can drag and drop built-in components or the ones you have already done.
Once you are ok with this **sheet**, you can create a new component. This component takes the sheet inputs and outputs as inputs and outputs.

## Components 🧰 :

You have in this application a range of **components**, one part is the built-in **components**, combined with the ones you *created*, or even the ones built by the *community* ! 🌎

## Wires 🔌 :

The components you placed have some nodes, *the inputs and the outputs*, you can clic on them and drag to create **wires**. The **wires** connect two nodes, one *input* and one *output*. They transmit power from its *input* to its *output*.

## Activation ✔️ :

You can define how many *inputs* and *outputs* a sheet has. These *nodes* behave exactly as the components ones, you can link them with other *nodes*. At last you can **activate** or **deactivate** them and see what happens on the *nodes* of the sheet, and on the *outputs* !

## Sharing, modification :: :

Each sheet is saved as a component in a *.json* file. You can easily modify them and share them.
